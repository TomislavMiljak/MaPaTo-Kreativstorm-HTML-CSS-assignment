Hi Malavika and Paulo!

I just created this repository through Git Hub Desktop for practice, and I want to share it with you! 

Of course we don't need to use this repository for our assignment, 
as I'd be totally okay and thankful to either of you 
for creating another one and hosting it for us all, if we'd agree on that.

I'd also be comfortable with hosting for us either in this repository, or another one, 
especially if we'd come up with a more topic related name.

But for now I just wanted to practice creating a joined repo and sharing it with you.

Looking forward to our joined work :)

Even if it would be tricky to resolve code conflicts, I am looking forward to communicating with you and finding appropriate solutions.

Best greetings,

Tomislav
